# Time Series  


## 1. Objectives  
Students must be able to describe, analyse, model, and forecast future observations;to use R statistics programme to model economic and financial data sets.  

## 2. Contents  
1. Time series data and their characteristics. Measures of dependence: autocorrelation and cross-correlation. Stationary time series. Estimation of correlation. Use of R for time series analysis.  
2. Exploratory data analysis. Estimation of trend, cycle and seasonal components. Loess, STL and decompositions.  
3. Time series models. ARMA models. Integrated ARIMA models for nonstationary data. Multiplicative Seasonal ARIMA models. Estimation and forecasting. Exponential smoothing methods.  
4. Visualizing and forecasting big time series data. Representation of many time series. Summarization of main characteristics. Automatic model selection. Automatic forecasting.   

## 3. Evaluation methodology
The evaluation has two moments: one test (T) and a Project (P) evolving a time series modeling; the project must have a report and will be presented by the students.
Final mark is given by: FM=0.5T+0.5P 


FINAL GRADE: Test:17.2; Project (**TO BE DELIVERED**). FINAL MARK: (**TO BE CALCULATED**)
